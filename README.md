In the current day and age the average life span of a person is 70. But the death rates mostly 
include youth. And many other lose their lives because of not having proper medication or by not 
doing proper pre-medication at home before they were taken to hospital. So, the project takes that 
very theme to make people understand the importance of pre-medication that need to be done at 
home before a person is taken to a hospital. In that way at least few lives can be saved. So, the 
community that was visited by me was a mix of people who knew about pre-medication and 
people who didn’t know anything about it. But as a whole many of them hadn’t had the adequate 
knowledge about pre-medication and many doubts and clarifications were cleared in the process 
of explaining them the importance of pre-medication.
