                There are enough confusions about what to eat and what not to eat and on top of that most of us fall prey to the bewildering information available
        on internet regarding calorie count of food items. So, here it is. Whether you are clean eater or a calorie watcher, unless you have consulted a
        nutritionist or dietician, it is difficult for anyone to maintain a stringent food habit with the exact calorie count.

        you while you look out to develop a healthy lifestyle with a clean eating habit. This Indian food chart with calorie count has been
        designed by Gympik’s diet expert and Nutritionist, Sujetha Shetty to help the promising health enthusiasts and of course, normal
